## Design Question

How can I make the Newschool bulletin board more efficient and organized to ensure that the needs of the advertiser are being fulfilled faster and more accurately?

<br>

## Problems

* Disorganized and Inefficient
* Seen by only a minute fraction of the student body
* No semblance of any system.

<br>

## Core Functions

* Sale of Goods and Services (Mostly Used……the goods, not the services….there are no such things as used services).
* Roommate search (housing)
* Advertising for events

<br>

## Design Concept

An eBulletin board (Website) for New School members (students and staff) that provides a community and marketplace for the exchange of products and services, and a place to advertise events and meetups of any size.

## Why it would work?

The College student is a unique demographic. College tuition is a burden in of itself but add to that the cost of supplies, food and rent, that burden weighs you down further. This is why students are always on the lookout for second hand supplies and shared accommodation. The current student network systems employed at the Newschool to assist with such transactions are essentially a pin up board with a clatter of posters and a group mail. The Newschool Bulletin Board is a website digitizes that platform adding organization and the ability to stream your searches resulting in increased efficiency and an expanded network.
